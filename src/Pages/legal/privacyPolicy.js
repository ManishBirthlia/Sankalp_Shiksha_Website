								<b>Where and why does SANNKALP collect information on or through the website?</b>

								{' '}
								We do not ask you for any personal information if you are just visiting our website.
								However, for you to take advantage of some of our services, we will ask for some
								personal information. Also in order to help us continually to learn and improve our
								content and services, data is collected in an anonymous and aggregated manner, for
								example the number of visitors to certain pages or the use of such features as e-cards
								and tell-a-friend. Some personal data such as name, address and preferences are
								collected when you donate on our website and when you sign up for a sponsorship. The
								data you provide enables us to give you information in a personalised manner. Data such
								as credit card numbers or other billing information are collected in order to process a
								donation.

								Personal data collected is not distributed, shared, rented or sold to companies or

								parties, such services are acquired under the understanding that all personal
								information is treated confidentially and only for the purpose of SANNKALP. If compelled
								by law or some other regulatory authority, SANNKALP may share personal information. This
								is also valid if we have good reason to believe that there has been an inappropriate
								interference with or use of our website. In such cases we maintain the right to disclose
								personal information as we deem appropriate, or as asked for by a legal or regulatory
								authority. Aggregated, statistical and other non-personal information such as the number
								of visitors to our website and their use of certain features or services may be shared
								with third parties working with us, for example for the promotion of our website.
